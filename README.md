### Body Mass Index (BMI) Tracker with React
It is a site that calculates the body mass index based on the height and weight values received from the user, and also offers a list of suitable diets according to BMI.
The values we reflect on the chart are currently stored in local memory. 
Also we perform the pages like "What is the BMI ?", "About","Contact". 
The last, the diets we offer retrieval by Spoonacular API.
